All code developed during the skripsie project titled: "Z-wave Open Source Home Automation Network Simulated in SimPy"

The SimPy simulation models model the operation of the z-wave protocol. The simulation model is currently configured according to the physical topology of the testing environment utilized during the Skripsie. Additionally current command sequence being sent replicates the command sequence sent when adjusting the brightness of the lightbulb.

The test Python scripts are ran on the Raspberry Pi in order to create the z-wave network and manage the transmission of commands in order to analyse the networking results achieved.
